# ML-Malware-Detection

This repository is part of a machine learning project aimed at detecting malware from system features using the LightGBM framework.

Dataset is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data>

## Installation

A virtual environment is suggested and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project File Structure

Below is the organization of the repository, detailing the purpose of each file and directory:

### `Archive/`

- This directory is for archiving older versions or unused files.

### `Code/`

- Contains the primary scripts for the project, categorized by their role in the workflow:
  - `1_data_sample_split.py`: Script for data sampling and splitting into train and test sets.
  - `2_data_cleaning.py`: Code for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - `3_model_training.py`: Script for training the machine learning model.
  - `4_calculate_accuracy.py`: Code to calculate the model's accuracy post-training.

### `Data/`(ignored by Git)

- The directory where all datasets are stored:
  - `train.csv`: The original training dataset file.
  - `X_test_encoded.csv`, `X_train_encoded.csv`: Encoded feature datasets for testing and training.
  - `X_test.csv`, `X_train.csv`: Raw feature datasets for testing and training.
  - `y_test_encoded.csv`, `y_train_encoded.csv`: Encoded label datasets for testing and training.
  - `y_test.csv`, `y_train.csv`: Raw label datasets for testing and training.

### `Feature_importances/`

- Contains files that provide insights into the significance of each feature used in the model:
  - `FeatureImportance_lgbm.csv`: A CSV file listing the importance scores of features from the LightGBM model.

### `Model/`

- Stores the trained model files and related information:
  - `info.txt`: Metadata or additional information about the model's training and performance.
  - `model_lgbm.p`(ingnored by Git): The saved LightGBM model ready for making predictions or further analysis.

### `Result/`

- Contains the outcomes of the model's predictions:
  - `result_lgbm.csv`: The CSV file with prediction results from the LightGBM model.
